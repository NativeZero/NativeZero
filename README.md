👋 Hi, I’m @Native0

👀 I’m interested in exploring the intersection of Rust and blockchain technology, delving into the depths of decentralized systems and building robust, efficient applications.

🌱 I’m currently learning Rust programming language to harness its power in creating secure and high-performance software, as well as diving into the intricacies of blockchain development to understand its potential applications and implications.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Rust development, blockchain protocols, or applications leveraging decentralized technologies. Whether it's contributing code, brainstorming ideas, or conducting research, I'm eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals passionate about these fields.

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy experimenting with cooking recipes from different cultures and cuisines, finding parallels between the creativity in cooking and coding.
